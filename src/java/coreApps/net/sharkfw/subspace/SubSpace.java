/**
 * A sub space is defined by a peer. A sub space has features:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> Each sub space has its own unique SI which is a combination
 * of creators identity and creation time.
 * <li> A creator can introduce other peers participating in the sub space.
 * Peer can be full member or read only member. Full member can add and read
 * information. 
 * <li> A sub space stores its data in a shark knowledge base. This KB has no
 * direct knowledge port - communication is mediated by means of a Sub Space knowledge
 * port. 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Access to sub spaces is mediated by means of sub space knowledge ports. A
 * sub space KP is automatically created by creating a sub space. It's interest has
 * the following structure:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Topic is the sub space with it's unique SI.
 * Thus, the sub space topic describes a single entity - the sub space itself.
 * It can piggy-back additional topics, though. That's done with a property, that
 * can include topics. It is up to the sub space kp to use or ignore those piggy-back 
 * topics.
 * <li>Peers comprises all full member including sub space owner which are already 
 * subscribed to the sub space. 
 * <li>Remote peers contains any member (full and r/o) including owner which are already 
 * subscribed to the sub space. 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * A sub space is created by an owner. It defines full and r/o member. 
 * An initial interest is sent to all members. Peer list contains only the owner
 * with this initial interest. Full member get an interest with in / out direction.
 * Readonly member get just a OUT interest - they can only receive data.
 * 
 * Sub spaces can be defined to be open or closed. Open sub spaces accept also
 * peers that are not on the initial member list. Closed sub spaces ignore any
 * attempt from not invited peers joining the sub space.
 * 
 * A peer can join the sub space by sending an interest to sub space owner.
 * That interest contains sub space topic and the peer in peer dimension.
 * Owner will out the peer to peers dimension and will resent the sub space interest
 * to all subscribed member. Thus, any member knows all other member.
 * 
 * Peers can add information to sub space. New information are send to all
 * subscribed peers. 
 * 
 * A peer can unsubscribe by sending the initial interest with direction set
 * to NO_DIRECTION to owner. Owner peer will remove the peer from peers dimension 
 * and resent the interest to all other subscribed peers.
 * 
 * The communication is managed by the sub space knowledge port implementation 
 * in this package. Application developer only need to use the sub space interface
 * or derived classes.
